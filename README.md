## Abstract:
Traditional attendance systems are vulnerable to issues such as buddy punching, time theft, and data tampering. This study proposes a blockchain-based attendance system that leverages the security, transparency, and decentralization of blockchain technology. The system utilizes smart contracts to automate attendance tracking and validation, ensuring the integrity and immutability of attendance data. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system in providing a secure, transparent, and decentralized attendance tracking solution.

Keywords: Blockchain, Attendance System, Smart Contracts, Decentralized, Secure, Transparent.
